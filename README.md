# Portfolio Starter Kit

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio. This starter includes:

- Automatically configured to handle Markdown/MDX
- Generates an RSS feed based on your posts
- A beautiful theme included out of the box
- Easily categorize posts with tags
- Fast, optimized web font loading

## Setup
- Have node, and npm installed
- Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) `npm i --global yarn`
- `yarn dev`
- Open browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Configuration

1. Update your name in `theme.config.js` or change the footer.
1. Update your name and site URL for the RSS feed in `scripts/gen-rss.js`.
1. Update the meta tags in `pages/_document.js`.
1. Update the posts inside `pages/posts/*.md` with your own content.

## About Next.js Pages

In Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**Example**: If you create `pages/about.js` that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}

export default About
```

### Pages with Dynamic Routes

Next.js supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`, then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

> To learn more about dynamic routing, check the [Dynamic Routing documentation](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md).
